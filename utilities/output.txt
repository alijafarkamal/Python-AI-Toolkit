Introduction

Structure of neuron. (Nerve cell, Dendrite, Axon, Myelin Sheath,  Synapse), 
Neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonin, Endorphins,  Acetylcholine) 

2. Central Nervous System

i. Brain  ii. Spinal Cord

3. Peripheral Nervous System

i. Somatic (a. Sensory nerves b. Motor nerves)

ii. Autonomic (Sympathetic, Parasympathetic Nervous System)

 
Structure and function of the Neuron

Neuron (nerve cell)

▪

Information-processing and information 
transmitting element of the nervous 
system 

▪ Types: Sensory, Motor, Interneuron

Five structures

1. Cell body (Soma): contains Nucleus 

which provides life to the cell

2. Dendrites: Treelike structure attached to 
soma, receives information from the 
terminal buttons of other neurons

Structure and function of the Neuron

Synapse (structure)

3. Axon: Long, thin, cylindrical structure, 
conveys information from the soma of a neuron 
to its terminal buttons

The axon ends in a cluster of Terminal buttons, 
which are small knobs secrete chemicals called 
Neurotransmitters.

4. Myelin Sheath: 

An insulating (protecting) material that encases 
some axons 

5. Synapse: A junction between the terminal 
button of an axon and the membrane of another 
neuron.

For transmission of information

Neurotransmitters

Definition:

A neurotransmitter is defined as a chemical that is released by a terminal button; has 
an excitatory or inhibitory effect on another neuron 

Important Neurotransmitters:

(cid:0) Dopamine

(cid:0) Serotonin

(cid:0) Endorphins

(cid:0) Acetylcholine

Peripheral Nervous System 

(cid:0) Periphery means (the outside)

(cid:0) The Peripheral Nervous System is made up 

of all those nerves that lie outside the 

brain and spinal cord. 

(cid:0) PNS has 2 subdivisions:

1. Somatic Nervous System

2. Autonomic Nervous System

Peripheral Nervous System

(cid:0)

The  Somatic  Nervous  System  is  made  up  of 

nerves  that  connect  to  voluntary  skeletal 

muscles and to sensory receptors.

The  Autonomic  Nervous  System  (ANS)  is  made  up 

of  nerves  that  connect  to  the  heart,  blood  vessels, 

smooth muscles, and glands.

digestion, and perspiration.

1. Sympathetic: Mobilizes body’s resources 
    in emergencies

2. Parasympathetic: conserves bodily resources

Divisions of Autonomic Nervous System

i. The sympathetic division

ii. The parasympathetic division

(cid:0) The sympathetic division is the branch of 

(cid:0) The parasympathetic division is the branch 

ANS that mobilizes the body’s resources 

of ANS that conserves bodily resources

for emergencies.

(cid:0) Slows digestive processes

(cid:0) E.g. promotes digestion

(cid:0) slows heart rate

(cid:0) Reduces blood pressure

The Central Nervous 
System

Hindbrain

CNS

Brain

Midbrain

Spinal Cord

Forebrain

Spinal cord

Brain

The  spinal  cord  connects  the 
brain    to  the  rest  of  the  body 
through  the    peripheral  nervous 
system

The crowning glory of the CNS is 
the Brain, weighs about 3 pounds. 
Contains billions of interacting  
cells that integrate information 
from  inside and outside the body

Bundles of axons carry the brain’s 
commands to  peripheral nerves 
and that relay  sensations from 
the periphery of the  body to the 
brain

Coordinates the body’s actions.
Enables human beings to talk, 
think, remember, plan, create, 
and dream

Division of Brain

1. The Hindbrain

2. The Midbrain

• Controls largely unconscious
• Controls 

breathing,  maintaining  

• Integration of sensory processes 

such as vision and hearing

muscle tone

• System of dopamine-releasing 

• Involved in sleep and arousal
• Coordination  of  movement,  sense  of 

equilibrium/ physical balance 

neurons

• Voluntary movements
• Modulation of muscle reflexes
• Breathing & pain perception

Damage to this brain part disrupts fine 
motor skills involved in writing, typing, or 
playing a musical instruments

Decline in dopamine synthesis causes 
Parkinson’s Disease

3. The Forebrain

• The forebrain is the largest and most complex region 

of  the brain

•Central role in the learning of fear  
        responses

•

All sensory information must pass sensing touch, 

•Learning, remembering, thinking,

hearing

• A Regulator of Biological Needs, hunger, thirst, sexual 

motivation, and temperature regulation

• One such function is to control the autonomic nervous 

system

• A vital link between the brain and the endocrine 

system

•

Basic biological drives related to survival, including 

the so-  called “four F’s”: fighting, fleeing, feeding, 
and mating.

• Emotion, memory, and motivation

•

Pleasure centers

Control over, such as fingers, lips, and  

•
        the tongue

•

•

Acquisition of new motor skills

Imitation of others

• The understanding of others’ intentions and 

the  ability to feel empathy

Reasoning about relations between  

•
        objects and events

•Decision making

•executive control system,” which is  
       thought to monitor, organize, integrate,  
      and direct thought
